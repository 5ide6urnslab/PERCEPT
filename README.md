## Description
#### Acceleration
This Acceleration is the 9DOF acceleration Arduino sketch that runs on Adafruit Trinket Pro (3V). It's necessary to add the  MPU9150 and XBee ZB for this system. We are currently developing that.

[](
#### Tabic\
This Tabic is the Sensor "Tabi" + "Music". It is Arduino sketch that runs on Adafruit Trinket Pro (5V). It's necessary to add the Registor 100kΩ and Conductive Film, Aluminum for this system. We are currently develoing that.\

## Running the Example Project
An example project is provided in the **/example/** folder.

#### Resonance 0.01
Intermedia collaboration project vol.1 with Naoko Ikegami (Contemporary dancer, Choreographer) and Momoko Noguchi (Composer, Sound programmer) , Show Kawabata(Electronics). This Performance staged at the Studio Mecca, Tokyo, JAPAN in 01/13/2016. The Acceleration "MultiAccelerationSim" and "PerceptAcceleration" have been used.
