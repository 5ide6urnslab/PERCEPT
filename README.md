## Description
#### Acceleration
This Acceleration is the 9DOF acceleration Arduino sketch that runs on Adafruit Trinket Pro (3V). It's necessary to add the  MPU9150 and XBee ZB for this system. We are currently developing that.

#### Tabic
This Tabic is the Sensor "Tabi" + "Music". It is Arduino sketch that runs on Adafruit Trinket Pro (5V). It's necessary to add the Registor 100kΩ and Conductive Film, Aluminum for this system. We are currently develoing that.
